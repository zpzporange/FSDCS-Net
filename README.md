### Installation

We support `python3`. To install the dependencies run:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

###  Input & Output

**Input**  : A set of stego JPEG images
**Output ** : A location map that indicates the embedding positions in the input images,
represented by a binary matrix with the same size as the input images

### Dataset

**Bossbase**. This dataset can be download [here](http://agents.fel.cvut.cz/stegodata/).
